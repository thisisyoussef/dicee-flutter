## Project Overview

Dicee is built using the Flutter framework and Dart programming language. Flutter is a UI toolkit that allows developers to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. The app has a simple yet visually appealing design, featuring images of dice that change randomly when tapped on.

The app's structure and files are organized into various directories, including:

- `android`: This directory contains the Android platform-specific code.
- `ios`: This directory contains the iOS platform-specific code.
- `lib`: This directory contains the main Dart source files for the application.
- `images`: This directory contains image assets used within the app.

Some major files include:

- `pubspec.yaml`: Used to manage dependencies and general project metadata.
- `lib/main.dart`: The main Dart file containing the starting point of the app.
